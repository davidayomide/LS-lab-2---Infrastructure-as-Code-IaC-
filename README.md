#**Microservices Application**

This is a microservices application that allows you to check the weather in any location. The application was built using python flask and pymongo and utilizes docker-compose to connect the various components of the application.

**Running the Application**

To run the weather checker, you need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your system. Once you have these prerequisites, you can follow these steps:

- Clone the repository containing the application code to your local system.
- Change into the directory containing the application code.
- Run the command docker-compose up to start the application.
- Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

**Functionality**

The weather checker allows you to input a location and displays the current weather conditions for that location. The weather information is retrieved from a third-party API and stored in a pymongo database for fast retrieval.

**Conclusion**

This is a simple weather checker that demonstrates the use of microservices and docker-compose. You can use the application as a starting point for building your own weather-related projects.
